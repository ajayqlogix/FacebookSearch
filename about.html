    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <ul id="faq">
      <li>
        <strong>Why do this?</strong>
        <p>We want to show how open Facebook has made your information. It's the least scary use that anyone will make of it. If nothing changes, it's only to get worse.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What's with the collateral damage? This stuff could ruin people's lives, now you're just as much as a jerk as Zuckerberg</strong>
        <p>Yes, this stuff could get people fired. Facebook has already had plenty of bad press about privacy but they don't seem to care. So now we're trying to make users care.
          (There's a great discussion over at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1346003">Hacker News</a> on the ethics of this.)
          <em>To be clear: any programmer can access your public data using the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/">Facebook API</a>. Do you really want this stuff in the hands of big corporations, advertisers or spammers?</em>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Aren't you just doing this for the geek cred?</strong>
        <p>No. This started as a fun project exploring the Facebook API. We were shocked that so many people obviously didn't understand they were making intimate details of their lives public.
          Hopefully the publicity will force Facebook to improve and get users to fix their privacy settings.

      <li>
        <strong>What should I do with my Facebook account?</strong>
        <p>You could <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+i+delete+my+facebook+account">delete it</a> or
          <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+Protect+Your+Privacy">fix your privacy settings</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Doesn't Twitter has the same problem?</strong>
        <p>Not really, if you compare Twitter search and our Facebook search then you see much more person details on Facebook.
          Twitter started as a public site and Facebook started as a private network and has been <a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">moving the goal-posts</a> over time.
          The user expectations are different.
